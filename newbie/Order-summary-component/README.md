### What I learned

-When "border-radius" doesn't apply, add "overflow:hidden" into the container.
-When using float, using multiple float pointing to the same direction with % width seems to work ok.
-To make a button 100% clickable, the "button" we have to apply "height: 100%" and "width: 100%" depending of the display.
-To center the content of a block with multiple block inside : "text-align: center"
